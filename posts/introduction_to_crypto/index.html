  <h1>Introduction to Cryptography</h1>
  <time datetime=2021-08-02T18:42:08-0300 class="post-date">Mon, Aug 2, 2021</time>
  <p>Hi everyone! In this post I present a brief introduction to cryptography. Hope you like!</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-cryptography">Introduction to Cryptography</h2>
<p>First, I want to introduce you to three very important people on cryptography. They are constantly referred to in papers, books, and in general crypto explanations. Their names are Alice, Bob, and Eve.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/AliceBobEve.png" alt="image info" title="Alice, Bob, and Eve"></p>
<p>Alice, Bob, and Eve are fictional characters used for representations, notable those related to processes that involve communication, like protocols. They were invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in their paper <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf">&ldquo;A Method for obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems&rdquo;</a>. Since then, it has become usual to use their names, and others like Carol and Dan, to refer to generic agents in many scientific and computing fields, like game theory and post-quantum cryptography.</p>
<p>Now, with the help of Alice, Bob, and Eve, I&rsquo;ll illustrate two different situations. They both represent good examples of WHY we should use cryptography in our digital security.</p>
<h3 id="situation-1-eve-is-eavesdropping">Situation 1: Eve is eavesdropping</h3>
<p>Alice and Bob are friends and want to communicate with each other through a communication channel. Although the information they need to send is sensible and should be kept as a secret, the channel is not secure and Eve is able to eavesdrop on the conversation (yes, Eve commonly represents the part that secretly intercepts the data due to &ldquo;Eavesdropping&rdquo;).</p>
